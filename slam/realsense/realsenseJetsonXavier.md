Required Info	
Camera Model	D435i

Platform	NVIDIA Jetson TX2

Issue Description
I am trying to working on intel-realsense D435i on the nvidia jetson TX2, I have followed the jetson hacks tutorials on installing the librealsense with the patches. https://github.com/jetsonhacks/buildLibrealsense2TX. My librealsense version is 2.21.0

I am able to run the D435i, but I am having problems with the timestamps, when I run the realsense viewer the IMU time says it uses the hardware clock whereas the rgb and depth image clock are not using the hardware clocks. I attach the screen shots below.

I also tested with the D435 with the jetson tx2 and it seems to be using properly the hardware clock.

I need the camera and the imu using the same hardware clock in order to perform VIO on the jetson. The D435i is working perfectly on a normal x64 ubuntu computer. Any helps would be appreciated.

Hi all,

I was able to solve this issue. For anyone to whom it might be useful, I explain I was able to achieve it.

I was using the https://github.com/jetsonhacks/buildLibrealsense2TXand the version 0.81 of the repo. When I ran the buildPatchedKernel.sh script, it was executing the patches from librealsene version 2.10.4 which did not include the latest changes for the D435i cameras and imu timestamps.

Changing the version of librealsense in the buildPatchedKernel.sh script from 2.10.4 to 2.21.0 and running the script again fixed the issue.

- **enable_sync**: gathers closest frames of different sensors, infra red, color and depth, to be sent with the same timetag. This happens automatically when such filters as pointcloud are enabled.
