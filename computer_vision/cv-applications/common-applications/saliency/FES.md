# Fast and Efficient Saliency Detection  

Matlab implementation of saliency algorithm proposed in:
[Fast and efficient saliency detection using sparse sampling and kernel density estimation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0161/777b4419411a4d2c5971a22683ee8691643f.pdf).
Rezazadegan Tavakoli H, Rahtu E & Heikkil√§ J, Proc. Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA 2011), 2011, Ystad, Sweden.  

The code has been tested on Matlab 2010a (32-bit) running windows. This code is publicly available for demonstration and educational purposes, any commercial use without permission is strictly prohibited.  

## project files

This package contains the following files and directories:  
1) calculateImageSaliency.p : computes image saliency for a single scale
2) calculateFinalSaliency.m : computes image saliency for multiple scales
3) runSaliency.m : a sample file to show how to compute saliency
4) prior.mat : a prior obtained via learning

## Run
1) Extract the package
2) run 'runSaliency.m'
